# Test File Hub
A Resource for File Upload Testing and Development

# Project Description:
TestFileHub is an online resource providing a curated collection of sample files in various formats (e.g., PDF, JPEG, PNG, DOCX, and ZIP) specifically designed to support developers, QA engineers, and IT professionals with testing file upload, download, and processing functionalities within their applications.

Whether youâ€™re testing file upload size limits, format validations, or download functionality, TestFileHub offers an extensive library of files, including different resolutions, sizes, and formats. By using these files, developers can more efficiently test file handling in a range of scenarios without having to create their own test data.

# Key Features:

- Multi-Format File Library: Access sample files in common formats like PDFs, images (JPEG, PNG), documents, and compressed files.
- Diverse File Sizes: Provides files ranging from a few KBs to several MBs, allowing for effective testing across varying upload size limits.
- Customizable Parameters: Allows users to generate custom files with specific parameters (e.g., file size, image resolution) for more tailored testing.
- User-Friendly Interface: A simple interface to quickly select, preview, and download files.
- Educational Resources: Provides guidelines on using test files for different scenarios, such as API testing, database storage, and file integrity checks.

# Potential Use Cases:
- Developers testing file upload functionality in web applications or mobile apps.
- QA Engineers validating format restrictions, file size limits, and upload/download behaviors.
- IT Teams setting up environments or troubleshooting file-handling issues in applications.
  
# Tech Stack:
- Frontend: HTML, CSS, JavaScript (React or Vue.js for enhanced user experience)
- Backend: Node.js or Python (Flask/Django)
- Database: MongoDB or PostgreSQL (for user-specific downloads, if required)
- Hosting: GitHub Pages (for front-end hosting) and cloud storage for larger files (AWS S3, Google Cloud Storage)
